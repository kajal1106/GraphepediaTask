Initially, I started looking around the given theme and it's functionality. As I previously observed,webpages on WordPress were pretty easy by using the customization and plugins. I knew that all themes have different customizations and plugings. Hence, when I first opened the homepage, there weren’t many customization options for me to work manually with the dashboard. Eventually, I
got more confused and started fiddling with the files and themes. I even checked and installed new plugings to check with the options. Most of my time here was wasted.
Then I started checking out the templates and the php files. I studied the files
and understood the flow of the website. I understood what kind of changes I make in some file reflects in the main pages.I started working on the home page which was based on the page-home template.
On the local machine, started working on the homepage based on html and CSS. Added the html code to the code editor for the page. I saw an additional css in the sidebar, so i initially added all my css for the page in that sidebar. I knew that this approach was wrong but I added just so that i wanted to check if it registers and reflects on the page. It did but some part of the CSS wasn’t. It was getting overridden. Also, the page was following the page-home.php template so there were many posts and header and things being injected into the page. I had to somehow remove it and just want the things i need in my page. I went into the theme editor to edit certain functions and code from the header.php file and page-home.php. I successfully removed the unwanted parts and was successful. But still had some CSS issues being overridden.
Hence, I went on to create my own stylesheet. I knew I could use FTP and upload it. But i wanted to see if i could do it manually through the dashboard. Hence, i wrote a php code in the function.php file using php touch which created a stylesheet(homepagestyle.css) Added my CSS code there. The next thing was to add this script to the functions.php file and register it. Also, since I wanted to load the CSS specifically for a certain page,I added a conditional statement in there.

One error that came up while editing the stylesheet was nonce_failure. I am assuming it was thrown because i was logged out and the page was still there. Once, i logged in again and updated the file, it worked out.
Another error was that the website was adding <br>s and <p>s automatically in between certain things. It was just popping up and using up space on the page creating chaos. I disabled this functionality by adding a function in the functions.php file.
Adding the remove_filter("the_content",'wpautop'); worked and stripped all the extra content from the page.
